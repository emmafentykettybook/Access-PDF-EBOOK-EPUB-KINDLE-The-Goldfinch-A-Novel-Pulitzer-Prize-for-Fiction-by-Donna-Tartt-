The Goldfinch: A Novel (Pulitzer Prize for Fiction) by Donna Tartt Book Review

Name: Booksalottle
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: 4.5-Stars: Divine, Modern Dickensian Tale of Art & Fate
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 25, 2019
Review: I loved Donna Tartt's 'The Goldfinch'. It is a novel I had anticipated reading for a long time, one which I had extremely high expectations for. I expected it to knock my socks off, and it did. From early on in my reading, it was immediately apparent that this was no doubt Tartt's magnum opus, proven by the fact that it garnered her the richly deserved Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2014.

With all that said, I must divide the novel's quality into two unequal parts: every plot development before the character of Boris was introduced is stellar, superb! Every plot development after the character of Boris was introduced and Boris was present for, was the one reason where this excellent novel almost became 4-Stars. The writing alone is 5-stars quality, but I despised Boris so much, he almost spoiled the book for me at certain parts.

Tartt's writing is exceptional, and emotions, raw and deep, resonate off every page. From the crisp, rhythmic opening scene in Amsterdam, to Theo's mother illuminating up off the page, my literary senses perked up from page one and were always fully engaged. The story has a breezy yet sophisticated charm to it, with laugh out loud humor intermixed with sobering adult themes. From the precocious observances of a young Theo and Andy, to the jaded but wise adults, - I found laughs aplenty. There is of course plenty seriousness, but Tartt expertly softens it with occasional jest. This dual combination works terrifically, making for a spirited reading experience.

Because the story of Theo, the boy who comes in possession of a Dutch Golden Age painting, the titular Goldfinch, is a bildungsroman, it became clear that there were Dickensian motifs peppered throughout the novel. Sometimes it is subtle, other times it is overt, with heavy allusions to 'Oliver Twist' and 'Great Expectations'. At any given time, it felt to me that Theo is a composite of Oliver Twist and Philip Pirrip (Pip), Boris is a composite of the Artful Dodger and Bill Sykes, Hobie is a composite of Mr. Brownlow and Joe Gargery, Mrs. Barbour is Miss Havisham, Pippa is Biddy and sometimes Estella, Kitsey is mostly Estella, and so on. Or at least that's how I interpreted the correlation between Tartt's characterizations and Dickens'. Tartt's use of the Dickensian motif is done well as it felt like a respectful homage, rather than a copy. The effect is never gimmicky or contrived, but is rather seamless.

As with many tales by Dickens, Tartt also gives us the bitter along with the sweet in the story of a young boy coming of age and finding meaning to his lfe. I appreciated the complex, angel/devil characterization she gave Theo, with multiple unsavory character traits and dubious actions. Lessons abound where in Theo's coming of age trek through his early life, he becomes a source of frustration for me the reader. The ostensibly bright, once thoughtful, and spirited young Theo detours down a questionable path. This is where the character of Boris comes in, leading me to dislike him immensely. As I read Theo's story, especially as he spiraled into debauchery and delinquency in Las Vegas, I could foretell the inevitable results of his stupid choices, choices mostly instigated by Boris. Unquestionably, fate dealt Theo a tough blow, but he himself makes no effort to go against the grain. He instead allows Boris to influence him. This turns to be a frustrating character development in Theo, but one that is stirring, nonetheless.

As we know of all Dickensian tales, Tartt also takes us through Theo's entire journey, ultimately ending at the cusp of his self-awareness, acceptance, and redemption. I must admit, It is hard to root for a drug using, love pining, art swindling rogue with dubious criminal tendencies. But yes, I was rooting for Theo the whole way. The beauty of it all being that for him to come out the other side, he had to discover the dirty parts of himself and the dark aspects of humanity. I thought Tartt did a wonderful job juxtaposing the two dualities. We're all saints and sinners in our own lives.

Lastly, unlike other readers, I did not mind the novel's length at all. As a matter of fact, I reveled in it. For me personally, as long as the themes and characterizations are sharp and taut throughout, the longer the better. Other than hating Boris' character, and disliking the delinquent time spent in Las Vegas, one other aspect I would have liked to be different was the tone of Theo's philosophizing towards the end. His waxing poetic was a beautiful act of contrition, and self-awareness. However, it did seem much too profound for someone so young as he. Not necessarily with additional plot, but I wished Tartt had aged him into his 30s or 40s by the book's close when he came to all his personal conclusions. His self actualization of his fate felt more like something someone older would have come to realize, years after living life. Rather than from him at age 27. His philosophizing did work, but coming from someone as young as he, it felt a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, this section was wonderful to read, as it lovingly fused the importance and meaning of beauty, art, life's split second choices, in all our lives.

I enjoyed reading 'The Goldfinch' as it is marvelous and multi-faceted, shining bright in countless ways. Each character in the novel, even Boris that I loathed, imparted a sharp lesson as I read, the plot is rich and lively, the bildungsroman themes are prevalent and effective, the prose is gorgeous and evocative. All this while the beauty and mastery of classical art emanates off each chapter as the story unfolds. I knew some facts about Dutch Golden Age paintings, but in reading this novel, Tartt taught me even more, in a manner that is accessible and applicable. For me, this entire combination makes 'The Goldfinch' an exquisite read: magical in some parts, heart-breaking in others, wholly sublime in full. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars out of 5.

Title: The Goldfinch
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 14, 2014
Review: How quickly can the circumstances of one‚Äôs life alter? In less than a heartbeat it would seem ‚Äì or in the brief seconds in which a bomb blast can occur. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ‚ÄòThe Goldfinch,‚Äô Donna Tartt examines how transitory are the conditions that govern our lives.

Thirteen-year old Theo Decker and his beloved mother seek temporary shelter in New York's Metropolitan Museum during a rainstorm. While inside, a bomb goes off, and Theo‚Äôs mother dies in the wreckage. Theo, dazed and possibly suffering from a concussion, lingers at the side of a dying man he‚Äôd spotted moments before the blast. The man, Welty, hands Theo an heirloom ‚Äì a ring ‚Äì that will ultimately lead Theo to the kindly ‚ÄòHobie.' In his death throes, Welty gestures frantically toward a painting, suggesting to the boy that he wishes him to take it - to save it, one supposes, from being destroyed in the wreckage. The painting is Carel Fabritius‚Äôs famous work, ‚ÄòThe Goldfinch.‚Äô The blast in the museum, the chance meeting of a boy and a dying man, and a 'stolen' masterpiece are the points from which all future events in Theo‚Äôs life will stem.

Orphaned, grieving, plagued by survivor‚Äôs guilt, Theo goes to live with the family of school friend, Andy Barbour. The Barbours, a wealthy, socially prominent family, are peculiar and oddly broken in some ways. Still, the coolly elegant Mrs. Barbour and her emotionally ill husband give Theo a home of sorts in New York‚Äôs elegant Upper West Side, but it proves to be temporary. Soon, Theo‚Äôs deadbeat dad and his companion, the flashy Xandra, show up to take Theo back home with them for purposes that turn out to be less than honorable. Home is Las Vegas.

While in Vegas, Theo is on his own. His father‚Äôs neglect of his son is stunningly depicted, and Theo, making friends with a cagey Russian boy named Boris, spirals downward into alcoholism and drug addiction.

Eventually, Theo ends up back in New York, this time living with James Hobart, a furniture restorer and the friend and partner of Welty, the dying man Theo had comforted in the museum. Also staying with Hobart from time to time, is Welty‚Äôs granddaughter, Pippa, the unattainable redhead who continues to captivate Theo. Now in his twenties, Theo renews his friendship with the Barbours, and begins a shady career of selling restorations as antiques to would-be collectors who have more money than knowledge about what they're buying.

This eventually comes back to haunt him ‚Äì as does the painting he took from the Museum so many years ago, and which, throughout the book, continues to serve as a catalyst for many of the events in Theo‚Äôs life. Improbably, Theo meets up again with Boris in New York, learns that Boris took the painting from him without his knowledge, and that The Goldfinch is probably in Amsterdam, in the possession of criminals. The remainder of the book details Theo‚Äôs attempt to regain the painting with Boris‚Äôs help.

Tartt's book has been called Dickensian in its scope, and indeed there are elements that will be familiar to readers of Dickens: the orphaned boy (Theo), the Artful Dodger (Boris), the disparity in economic conditions for the poor and rich, and there is even a hint of Miss Havisham in the elderly Mrs. Barbour. I do read Dickens, and on one key point I find Tartt upends the Dickensian comparison: one would be hard-pressed to find in his works the nihilism that Tartt's book espouses. At the heart of Charles Dickens' stories and novels one can always find goodness in the muck, and hope hiding amidst the cesspools of human greed. Tartt looks at life through Theo's eyes and finds nothing but despair.

There is much to like and admire about The Goldfinch.

I like a lengthy book (and make no mistake ‚Äì this is a very lengthy book, almost 800 pages). I eagerly followed Theo‚Äôs journey through most of them.

Tartt stirringly relates the events that occurred immediately following the blast at the museum - you feel the devastation and confusion, the sense of isolation, the fear. She convincingly depicts a child's grief at the loss of the one parent he could depend upon, the fears he experiences at being caught up in the nightmare of Social Services agencies, and his slow but sure drift toward lawlessness and addiction.

And then there were the descriptions of gentle, graceful moments, captured no less vividly than the scenes of horror earlier in the book. She describes the subtle shadings of light gliding across aged patinas and the well-oiled grain of furniture in Hobie‚Äôs ‚Äòhospital‚Äô for damaged antiques, the prisms of color filtering through skylights, the delicacy of an artist‚Äôs brushstrokes on a canvas. I loved these peaceful descriptions.

I also admired the compelling imagery of the desert surrounding the bright lights of Las Vegas. She eerily interpreted Theo's neighborhood as a vast and scorching ghost town, filled with uninhabited houses in the middle of nowhere. Every day in the desert was the same - mind numbing, soul-destroying. The perfect place to self-destruct. And self-destruct is what Theo did.

My favorite parts of the book dealt with Theo working alongside Hobie, watching him meticulously mend damaged pieces of fine old furniture, losing himself in the process of trying to make the ruins whole again. How apt that Theo would find some measure of peace in Hobie‚Äôs workshop since he, too, was in need of mending. But like the antiques that Hobie sought to restore, Theo would never be entirely whole again. Nor would he be authentic, never again ‚Äòthe real deal‚Äô ‚Äì too much has happened to him. He is the walking wounded.

If you‚Äôre looking for redemption, you won‚Äôt find it in Theo‚Äôs journey, which recounts his story from age thirteen to his mid-twenties. With his mother‚Äôs death and the ‚Äòtheft‚Äô of the painting, his is a downward spiral that never seems to quite reach rock bottom. At book's end, this reader wondered if Theo would one day take his life. Filled with ennui and lack of purpose, still addicted to prescription drugs, one suspects Theo will try again to leave the world behind, in spite of all his high-flown philosophizing at the end of the story. Like his beloved Goldfinch, eternally chained to its perch, Theo is chained to circumstances that were set in motion on that tragic day in the museum. He will forever be defined by those events.

If you‚Äôre looking for an uplifting story, this is not it. From start to finish, the story is an unhappy one. And yet, I enjoyed it. I never lost interest in Theo's story or his journey, even in the story's most nihilistic moments.

My reservations about the novel stem entirely from its ending in which Tartt seems to abandon story-telling and instead wraps the conclusion of the book into some sort of touchy-feely fatalism that never quite rings true. Theo's philosophical rhapsodizing seems somehow false, forced. It is self-indulgent and lacking clarity. It is also boring.

Even so, I recommend The Goldfinch ‚Äì and happily give it 5 stars. Tartt has written a book grand in scope, vivid in imagery, thoughtful, and affecting. If it is not perfect, few things are. It is one of the best books I‚Äôve read in some time, and I won't soon forget Theo's sad odyssey.
